# Filelinks Search Plugin

## Getting Started
enable the plugin, it will be listed as Search - Filelinks

the basic options are:
* Search Limit
* Search published off/on
* Search archived off/on

you need to have at least one of the options on.

The plugin will only display filelinks that the user is authorised to view and that match the extensions set in the options of the com_filelinks component.
