#Filelink editors-xtd plugin
This allows you to easily insert the markup required by the Filelinks content plugin into any article. The button has no plugin options - it simply calls the modal view of the Filelinks Items.   
Simply position your cursor where you want the link inserted in the editor, click the button and choose the item. You have the normal filters and search for the items.  
Alternatively, click on any Category in the list and category list markup will be added instead.

For a category list the button inserts the markup within a div with a class of filelistcat - this is necessary for the output to validate. Tested on a number of popular content editors but it is not foolproof.  
If you position your cursor within a heading for instance and then add a category list the editor can get confused, so best practice is to position your cursor on a blank line.
