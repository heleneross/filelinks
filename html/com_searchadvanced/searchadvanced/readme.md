## Advanced Search template override ##

I used this template override in 

templates/mytemplate/html/com_searchadvanced/searchadvanced/default_result.php

to customise the output of each search result.

Specifically I want the displayed url to be relative and href to have site url prefixed.

Also wanted to get rid of text that says ROOT in categories shown
